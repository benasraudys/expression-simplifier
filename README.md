# Expression Simplifier

## Instructions:
To simplify an expression, follow these steps:

1. Pass an expression string as an argument when running the program, or type it in when prompted. Alternatively, if no argument is provided, the program will prompt you to enter a file name containing multiple expressions, each separated by a new line.
2. The expression can only contain whole numbers, both negative and positive.
3. Ensure that the expression is error-free. If the program detects any errors in the expressions provided in the file, it will output 'null'.
4. Allowed operations include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
5. The expression must not exceed 100 characters in length.
6. The program automatically removes unnecessary whitespace for simplification.
