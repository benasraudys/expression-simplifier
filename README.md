## Instructions:
To simplify an expression, follow these steps:

1. Pass an expression string as an argument when running the program, or type it in when prompted.
2. The expression can only contain whole numbers, both negative and positive.
3. Ensure that the expression is error-free.
4. Allowed operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
5. The program automatically removes unnecessary characters and whitespace for simplification.
